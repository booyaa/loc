# loc

A utility to display your current latitude and longtitude.

# Installation

Binaries to follow shortly once I've setup the automation. The underlying
library ([wifiscanner](https://github.com/booyaa/wifiscanner)) only supports
OSX / MacOS. So this utility is also limited by this.

```
git clone https://github.com/booyaa/loc.git
cd loc
cargo install
```
# Usage

`loc`
